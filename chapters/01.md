## 1.1.1

- Every powerful programming language must contain the following three things:
    - Primitive Expressions: the building blocks of a language, the simplest forms that data can take
    - Means of combination: a way to build compound elements from simpler elements
    - Means of abstraction: a way to "store" or "save" elements for further and more complex manipulation

## 1.1.5

- Applicative order versus normal order: "Normal order" relies upon parsing operands first. "Applicative order" waits to evaluate operands until they are needed resulting in a double computation when evaluating a defined expression.
    - Applicative order evaluation can fully expand and reduce evaluations in one step.
    - Normal order evaluation is a two stop process in which values are first evaluated then applied
- Lisp uses applicative order evaluation because it is both more efficient and simpler when dealing with procedures that can not be modeled by substitution

# 1.1.6

- Conditional expressions are referred to as predicates in Lisp
- Lisp has a case analysis definition called `cond` which is fairly similar to a `switch` statement in JS. a list of expressions is analyzed in order, the first one that evaluates to true is defined. unlike javascript there is no default and if all expressions in the list evalute to false the `cond` simply returns `undefined`. also, there is no `break`
    - chaining `an else` after a `cond` can return a `default` like `switch` cases

## Exercise 1.1

```
10                                  -> 10
(+ 5 3 4)                           -> 12
(- 9 1)                             -> 8
(/ 6 2)                             -> 3
(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))                 -> 6
(define a 3)                        -> 3
(define b (+ a 1))                  -> 4
(+ a b (* a b))                     -> 19
(= a b)                             -> false
(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
    b
    a)                              -> 3
(cond ((= a 4) 6)
      ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
      (else 25))                    -> 16
(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))              -> 6
(* (cond ((> a b) a)
         ((< a b) b)
         (else -1))
   (+ a 1))                         -> 16
```

## Exercise 1.2:

```
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

## Exercise 1.3:

```
(define (sum-of-squares a b)
  (+ (square a) (square b)))

(define (is-smallest a b c)
    (and (< a b) (< a c)))

(define (sum-of-two-largest x y z)
    (cond ((is-smallest x y z) (sum-of-squares y z))
          ((is-smallest y z x) (sum-of-squares z x))
          (else (sum-of-squares x y))))
```

## Exercise 1.4:

If `b > 0` then add `a` to `b`, otherwise subtract `a` from `b`
